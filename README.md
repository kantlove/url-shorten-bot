# Renew SSL
Currently the app is using LetsEncrypt SSL service (it automates everything, very nice!). To renew the certificate, simply run:
```
cd /opt/letsencrypt
./letsencrypt-auto certonly -a webroot --webroot-path=/home/minhthai/webapp/echo-bot -d dev.mthai.me
```
After complete, the certificate files are stored at
`/etc/letsencrypt/live/dev.mthai.me/`.
A strong DHGroup generated by openssl is stored at
`/etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem`.
